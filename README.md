Elixir in a Team
================

> "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." — Martin Fowler

Well, you just arrived in a company to work with Elixir, but wait, there are a
lot of resources needed, behind coding! And the most important of all, is to
learn to code for your team. People will need to read your code, typing is
essential to leave your brain CPU resources focus on coding, instead of hunting
letters, code-style, architecture, HTTP, git, linux, and much more.
