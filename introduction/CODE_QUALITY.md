Code Quality
============


## Follow a Style

The codebase you’re working on needs to have a consistent style. If you’re part of a team then get together to establish a set of guidelines to work from. Simplify the effort by using existing styles in the community. Here are a few general points to keep in mind:

Use informative names for variables, functions, and classes. There is no reason to be clever or sly by naming things with a small handful of characters.
Don’t cram all your code within a couple of source files. Break your code into pieces where it makes sense.
At the same time, don’t create functions that do 20 different things. Keep functions focused on a particular… function.
Remain consistent with whitespace, naming, commenting, and the other rules you establish.
