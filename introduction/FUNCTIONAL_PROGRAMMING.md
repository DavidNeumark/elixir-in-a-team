Functional Programming
======================

## Basic

## Advanced

* [try-haskell](http://tryhaskell.org/) - because haskell is a pure functional
    programming, and maybe you come from OO world, you will need a wash brain...
    or even change your brain, and Haskell comes to save

* [learn-you-a-haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com) - amazing book to help you
    understand FP... a real wash-brain for OO devs... please, don't try to learn
    Scala and move slowly, unless you are fine to have a spaghetti paradigm in
    you code. 

* [future-learn](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/functional-programming-haskell)
- seems to be an excellent course

* [the-most-adequate-guide](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide)
- if you would love to code FP in javascript this guide is a must. Also very
    good to understand the concepts.
