# Calc

Simplest project, but focused on your reader (the programmer who will maintain
this code, or you in the future)


### Problem Description
Build a sum calculator for your fellow programmer, using ex_docs, specs, README, and all the stuff necessary to make a non mathematician to understand your software. 

### Creative Solution
What is the project name ? Sum ? if sum, this is the function name. Maybe "Calculator" ? If we want to add more calculations, it's fine! But if it's only sum ? Math !  If we call calculator for only one "sum", would confuse our fellow programmer !  Calculator for a project name can be too big... let's call it calc.

What about the function name ? sum or add ? They are synonymous, but what is the better option ? After some research, see the tip below:

They're pretty much the same. Addition is usually used to denote summation of 2 numbers, whereas summation is used for sequences of numbers.

'Sum' is also used to denote the result of a summation/addition.

Summing is the result of adding n versions of a function or equation together, which is denoted using Î£.

What about the variables ?  x ? var1 ? but theses are not summing knowledge to our fellow programmer!  Let's call number ?
